					<br><b>Filling</b>
					<br>A filling repairs and restores the surface of a tooth that
					has been damaged by decay, fracture, or wear. A dental filling
					strengthens the tooth. If tooth decay is not repaired at its early
					stages, it will worsen and additional or alternative dental
					treatments may be necessary. With proper care and routine oral
					hygiene, a filling has a lifespan of 5-12 years, depending upon the
					type of filling material used. <br> <br> 
					
					<b>Root Canal/Endodontics </b>
					<br> An endodontic treatment saves a severely
					injured, cracked, or decayed tooth when its pulp (the soft inner
					tissue inside a tooth's root canal) becomes inflamed or infected.
					If it is not treated promptly, pain or a tooth abscess (infection)
					results. Endodontic treatment is also known as a "root canal." Root
					canal treatment is completed in one or two office visits, depending
					on the presence of infection and the required treatment plan. After
					restoration, the tooth continues to function like any other tooth.
					With good oral hygiene, the restored tooth has the potential to
					last a lifetime. <br><br>
					
					<b>Gum Diseases/ Periodontics</b>
					<br> Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is a bacterial infection of the gums
					and tissues that support your teeth. It is caused most often by the
					build-up of plaque and tartar when teeth are not routinely brushed
					and flossed. There are two major stages of periodontal disease:
					gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis affects only the gums. It
					is a mild form of gum disease, and if properly treated, may be
					reversed. Left untreated, gingivitis turns into periodontitis.
					During this more destructive disease stage, bacteria penetrate into
					the deeper pockets of tissue where bone and membrane support your
					teeth. Periodontitis can lead to tooth loss and serious health
					problems. <br> <br> 
					
					<b>Oral Surgery</b> 
					<br> While the
					removal of wisdom teeth is the most well-known type of oral
					surgery, there are many reasons why oral surgery may be required,
					including: Repairing or treating serious conditions affecting a
					patient's teeth, palate, lips, jaw or face Alleviating problems due
					to obstructed sleep apnea, infections or facial pain Repairing
					maxillofacial region damage caused by a serious accident or injury<br><br>

					<b>Cosmetic Dentistry</b> 
					<br> Cosmetic dentistry has become
					increasingly popular in recent years due to celebrities and other
					public figures choosing to enhance their appearance with dental
					procedures. Cosmetic dentistry has many different aspects, and it
					is important to work with your dentist to decide what is best for
					you. With the increased interest in cosmetic dentistry, many
					advances have been made in recent years so that we are able to
					improve your smile using simple, quick, painless and affordable
					treatments.
